## Development

I wanted to make this project, because i needed a quick and easy hex color generator. I always struggle to find color combinations i like, and also fit together. I included a select option to change between the modes, to accomodate for different needs. The project itself did not take that long, and was a nice refresher for my angular know-how.

## Usage

Essentially you just copy a hex color code that you need a fitting scheme for, and paste it in one of the 5 inputs. According to the selected mode you will get a fitting color scheme. If you want to quickly copy the colors, you can just click the code button and there will be a list of the color codes in all the variations.
